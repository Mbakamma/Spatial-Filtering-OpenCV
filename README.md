Image Processing with OpenCV
This repository contains practical examples of image processing techniques implemented using OpenCV in Python. The examples cover various operations such as filtering, sharpening, edge detection, and more. Below is a brief overview of what each section includes:

Setup
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

Topics Covered
1. Spatial Operations
Spatial operations involve neighborhood pixels to enhance or modify image characteristics. Techniques covered include:

Mean Filtering: Smoothing noisy images using a simple mean filter.
Gaussian Blur: Reducing noise while preserving edges using Gaussian blur.
Median Filtering: Removing noise effectively while preserving image details.
2. Image Sharpening
Image sharpening involves enhancing edges to improve image clarity. This is achieved using specific convolution kernels.

3. Edge Detection
Edge detection identifies points in an image where the brightness changes sharply. Techniques covered include using Sobel filters for gradient approximation.

4. Thresholding
Thresholding is used to segment images based on pixel intensity. Techniques covered include global thresholding with Otsu's method.

Examples
Each topic includes practical examples with detailed explanations and code snippets to demonstrate implementation. The examples use publicly available images for illustration.

Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-processing-opencv.git
Navigate to the project directory and run the Python scripts to see the examples in action.
